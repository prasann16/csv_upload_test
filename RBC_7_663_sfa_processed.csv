"First of all, the AD was good, I normally hate ads and even have an Ads blocker. But this AD sent shivers down my spine and I wouldn't mind seeing Ads like that. Second, I noticed that it's specifically targeted toward young adult in accordance to their hobbies. It's a good idea and as a young adult, this AD really picked my interest. It wasn't too fast paced and was easy to follow. However, I'd say that it might be a good idea to tone down on the colors a bit. If the target audience is young adult, color that pop right into your face make you feel like you're seen as a complete child. While colors and shapes are fun, if you show you present your AD like you'd show to a child, teenagers and young adult will feel less recognized for their maturity. But overall, I see nothing wrong with it and I quite honestly enjoyed it. Just take a moment to rethink about how often splash of colors appear and maybe take out 1 of these transition or make it more gray-scaled for a transition from childhood to teenage hood. It would really reflect growth and changes, that a simple fun hobby can become a lot more.
